-- Total Sales by Month (Area Chart):
-- Visualize the monthly distribution of total sales to identify peak periods.

-- Total Sales by State (Filled Map):
-- Geographically represent total sales across different states using a filled map.

-- Total Sales by Region (Donut Chart):
-- Use a donut chart to represent the contribution of different regions to total sales.

-- Total Sales by Product (Bar Chart):
-- Analyze the sales distribution among various Adidas products using a bar chart.

-- Total Sales by Retailer (Bar Chart):
-- Visualize the contribution of different retailers to total sales using a bar chart.


CHALLENGES:

-- Had trouble importing the dataset, Units Sold have white spaces so it was truncated, instead of total 9641 it imported 9588. 
-- created a new Column in excel and used TRIM function to remove the white spaces. Upon import in Workbench, did not include the original column.



Steps: 

-- 1.) DUPLICATE DATASET 
-- 1.1) FIX Retail Name
-- 2.0) FIX DATES - Change format ( single digit month has no 0 & there are with 0)
-- 2.1) FIX PRODUCT - Men's "aparel" to Men's Apparel
-- 2.2) Determine the 0 value in price per unit && find why there is 0 in total sales, operating profit
-- 3.) CHANGED DATA TYPES OF DATE, TEXT TO VARCHAR
-- 4.) CLEAN THE OUTLIERS such as NEGATIVE Values
-- 5.) ADD COLUMN "Operating Margin" = (operating profit/price per unit) x 100
-- 6.) ANSWER EVERY QUESTION FOR ANALYSIS

SQL Comments: 
-- 1.) DUPLICATE DATASET 
-- 2.) FIX Retail Name
-- 3.) FIX DATE FORMAT
-- 4.) FIX PRODUCT - Men's "aparel" to Men's Apparel
-- 5.) Determine the 0 value in price per unit && find why there is 0 in total sales, operating profit
-- 6.) CHANGED DATA TYPES OF DATE, TEXT TO VARCHAR
-- 7.) CLEAN THE OUTLIERS such as NEGATIVE Values
-- 8.) ADD COLUMN "Operating Margin" = (operating profit/price per unit) x 100
-- 9.) ANSWER EVERY QUESTION FOR ANALYSIS

-- DATA TYPES CHANGE - Invoice Date 'text' to 'date', price_per_unit from 'text' to int, total sales 'text' to 'int'
-- operating profit 'text' to 'int'




1.) DONE
2.) Changed column name ï»¿Retailer TO Retailer
3.) Changed format ( single digit month has no 0 & there are with 0) - FROM format  '%m/%d/%Y' TO '%Y-%m-%d'
4.) Found "Men's aparel" then changed it to "Men's Apparel" 
5.) 0's normal because no sales
6.) Changed the data types from TEXT to Varchar -> Price per Unit, Total Sales, Operating Profit
7.) NO NEGATIVE VALUES
8.) Added "Operating_Margin" - Removed "$", "," from Price per Unit, Operating Profit, Total Sales FOR CALCULATION [(Operating Profit/Total Sales) * 100]

Additional Querries: 
1.) Operating Profit total, AVG Price per unit, Operating Margin AVG



CHANGES:
CHANGED DATA TYPES OF DATE, TEXT TO VARCHAR


OVERALL PROCEDURES:

1.	Data Cleaning & Transformation

-	Imported a dataset containing 9,641 employees records into MySQL Workbench.
-	Duplicated the dataset for maintaining the original dataset.
-	Changed the column name from “ï»¿Retailer” to Retailer.
-	Modified the format of the Invoice Date column and changed the type into Date.
-	Normalized the values of Product column.
-	Converted the data types of the columns Price per unit, Total Sales, and Operating profit.

2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
-	Added a column Operating_Margin which calculated using the Operating Profit divided by the Total Sales and multiply the result by 100. Make those results as the values of the new 	column.
-	Conducted summary statistics such as Sum, Count, and Average (AVG) to understand the distribution of sales.

3.	Data Visualization
-	Visualized the monthly distribution of total sales to identify peak periods.
-	Geographically represented total sales across different states using a filled map.
-	Used a donut chart to represent the contribution of different regions to total sales.
-	Analyzed the sales distribution among various Adidas products using a bar chart.
-	Visualized the contribution of different retailers to total sales using a bar chart.

4.	Challenges Encountered
-	Had trouble importing the dataset, Units Sold have white spaces so it was truncated, instead of total 9641 it imported 9588.
-	Created a new Column in excel and used TRIM function to remove the white spaces. Upon import in Workbench, I did not include the original column.

5.	Tools and Technologies Used
-	MySQL Workbench for data storage and querying.
-	Used SQL for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) technique, data cleaning and transformations.
-	Implemented data visualizations using PowerBI.
-	Applied initial exploration in Excel.
